# Three-Point-Revolution-Project
## Summary
The "Three-Point Revolution" project aims to explore one of the most significant strategic shifts in the history of the NBA. Over the past few decades, the NBA has witnessed a transformation in how the game is played, with teams increasingly relying on three-point shooting as their main offensive strategies. Through this project, we will leverage historical NBA data to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create an interactive dashboard to better visualize the data. 

## Data Description 
The project will use data obtained through web scraping from a source known as Basketball-Reference. Basketball-Reference is a comprehensive website with a vast amount of historical NBA data, team stats, team rankings, and more. 
Data Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/

## Webscraping
Using powerful tools such as beautifulSoup and Selenium in Python to webscrape all the data needed to complete this project.

## Dashboard
The dashboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.do4230/viz/Basketball_dashboard/FinalDash#1


The repository contains the following files:
- a .ipynb notebook for webscraping (nba_webscraping.ipynb)
- a .ipynb notebook for data cleaning and merging dataframes (data_cleaning.ipynb)
- a csv file containing all the relevant NBA basketball stats merged together (all_data.csv)
